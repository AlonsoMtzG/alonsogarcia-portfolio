My portfolio web

**Hey there!**, I'm **Alonso Garc√≠a** and this is my personal web portfolio. I made it with HTML, and 'Less' CSS Preprocessor.

This is an update of my first portfolio, as I thought I could improve the design, make it a bit more attractive and interactive.

Here I show who I am, where I am from and some projects I have done. 

_Feel free to use my code as a template!_
